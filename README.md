# Frontend Mentor - Interactive rating component solution

This is a solution to the [Interactive rating component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI).  
This is also my very first React app. I'm open to all suggestions and improvements.

### Useful resources

- [Access props in functional component](https://medium.com/@PhilipAndrews/react-how-to-access-props-in-a-functional-component-6bd4200b9e0b) Helped me toggle active state on rate marks
- [Loop inside JSX](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22876978/loop-inside-react-jsx) - Helped me create 5 rate marks with the same component
